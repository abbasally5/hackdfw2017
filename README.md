## Inspiration
It has become increasingly important to be informed about what is going on in the world. However, actively searching out world views on the internet can be very time consuming. Therefore, we decided to give a WorldView of any topic at a glance.

## What it does
The user can search for a twitter hashtag and the data visualization shows the general twitter sentiment of the hashtag to the user. The color of the boxes correspond the general sentiment; green represents positive and blue represents negative.

## How we built it
We used three.js to power the front end data visualization and used flask, python, the Twitter API, and the library tweepy to power the backend. We also used TextBlob for the sentiment analysis.

## How to install
You will require a twitter api key

Replace the capitalized words in test.py
```
consumer_key = TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
consumer_secret = TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
access_token = TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
access_token_secret = TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
```
with your api credentials and you should be set!
